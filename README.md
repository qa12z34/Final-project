## INTRODUCTION

The diet of modern life is irregular, the work pressure is high, genetically modified foods, and cancer is commonplace in our lives. Breast cancer is the most frequently encountered cancer type in women and the second most terminal one after lung cancer. Due to the clinical experience of the doctors based on the doctor's work experience, relatively young doctors are not experienced enough to find early symptoms. It is very helpful if employed the artificial intelligent technique to assist doctors in diagnosing patients.

In this project, we used four methods to diagnose patients who had breast cancer. In order to train the model, we use the data from UC Irvine “Breast Cancer Wisconsin” data set. In this dataset, there are 569 entries, with 357 benign cases and 212 malignant cases. Each column contains 33 features, but there are some useless features. After comparison study, we found that Deep Learning could achieve better result without feature selection. 

Though these models cannot diagnose cancer conclusively, it could help physicians in deciding whether a biopsy is required by providing information about whether the patient has breast cancer or not. Using our models can help doctors prepare for diagnosis to provide effective information and improve the cure rate of early patients. Studies have shown that using machine learning methods to help doctors diagnose can give a more accurate result.
